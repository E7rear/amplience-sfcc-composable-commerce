# Automation

In order to save manual entry to use this starting point we have included an automation directory with all the relevant content and media

##Media

Take the media from `amplience/media` and upload to your Amplience Content Hub and publish.

## Content import

Install the Amplience Dynamic Content CLI as can be found [here](https://github.com/amplience/dc-cli)

Configure the CLI to point to your account (you will need your Amplience hub ID, clientID and clientSecret)

You will also need you repository IDâ€™s (Content and Slots) which you can get from [here](https://amplience.com/docs/intro/repositorysettings.html)

Run the following command replacing the variables with details from your Amplience account:

```
npm run import \
    --- --hubId <hubId> \
    --clientId <clientId> \
    --clientSecret <clientSecret> \
    --contentRepoId <contentRepoId> \
    --slotsRepoId <slotsRepoId>
```
